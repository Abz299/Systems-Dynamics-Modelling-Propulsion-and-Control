# Systems-Dynamics-Modelling-Propulsion-and-Control
This repository contains my state-space modeling and control implementation for a Quanser Helicopter, completed as part of my Systems Dynamics, Modelling, Propulsion, and Control module. The project explores flight dynamics, control theory, and system stability through MATLAB and Simulink.
