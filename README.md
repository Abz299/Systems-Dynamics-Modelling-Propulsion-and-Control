üöÄ Project Overview

1Ô∏è‚É£ Helicopter System Dynamics
Developed a state-space representation of pitch, roll, and yaw.
Implemented linearized system models for real-time simulation.
2Ô∏è‚É£ PID Controller Design
Created independent control loops for pitch and roll stability.
Tuned PID parameters to minimize tracking errors and overshoot.
Achieved a phase margin of 90¬∞, ensuring robust performance.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Augmented Psi (Yaw) Control
Designed a yaw controller using travel dynamics.
Integrated with roll control to optimize helicopter movement.
Validated system stability using Nyquist plots and Bode analysis.
